I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan.
<!-- My research interests are data center application optimizations and microarchitecture optimizations. I am also interested in Accelerators, Compliers and Operating Systems. -->


My research enables architectural simulations, characterizations, and optimizations of production web services. In particular, I propose a novel infrastructure to investigate and optimize production web services' micro-architectural behaviors using recently-released Google traces. I have also worked on optimizing the performance of uop cache for data center applications.

I presented my work on MICRO 2022 and received ACM Student Research Competitions 1st Place Award.

I am advised by Tanvir Ahmed Khan and Baris Kasikci. I also collaborate with Shuwen Deng, Heiner Litz, and Akshitha Sriraman. I have also closely worked with Google engineers, Derek Bruening and Victor Lee.

Recently, I presented my research to ACM student research competition at MICRO'2022 where I won [first place](https://twitter.com/takhandipu/status/1577813886312620032).

**I am applying for Fall 2023 Ph.D. programs. If you are hiring, please reach out to me at kanzhu@umich.edu.**.
