I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan.
My research interests are data center application optimizations and microarchitecture optimizations. I am also interested in Accelerators and Operating Systems.
I lead the Enabling Architectural Simulations and Optimizations of Production Web Services Project, in which we proposed Ally, a novel simulation and characterization infrastructure that enables studying web services’ micro-architecture behaviors using Google applications, and identify the main bottleneck as thread oversubscription and low prefetch bandwidth usage.
I cooperate with professor Baris Kasikci, Akshitha Sriraman, Heiner Litz, and industrial folks Derek Bruening, Abhinav Sharma, Sangeeta Bhattacharya, and Victor Lee. 
I present my work on MICRO 2022 and received ACM Student Research Competition 1st Place Award.
I am applying for Fall 2023 Ph.D. programs. Please consider me if you are recruiting.
