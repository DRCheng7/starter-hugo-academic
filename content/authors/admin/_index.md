**I am applying for Fall 2023 Ph.D. and Master programs. If you are hiring, please reach out to me at dddd@umich.edu**.

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Engineering at the University of Michigan. 
<!-- My research interests are data center application optimizations and microarchitecture optimizations. I am also interested in Accelerators, Compliers and Operating Systems. -->

My research interest focuses on embedded systems design and embedded security, aiming to design high-performance and safe embedded devices. In particular, my recent research worked on a project that aim to assess the possible information leakage from embedded device touchscreens. I discovered an approach to infer the touch position with a horizontal resolution of 4 mm on the screen. 

My works have already generated a first-authored poster submission to the 24th International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (HotMobile’23). I’m also working with a Ph.D. student of Prof. Kevin Fu on a conference submission to the 30th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS’23).

I am advised by [Kevin Fu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kevinfu/) from University of Michigan Security and Privacy Research Group. I also collaborate with [Alanson Sample](https://www.alansonsample.com/) from University of Michigan Interactive Sensing and Computing Lab.
