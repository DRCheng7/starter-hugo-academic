abstract: Touchscreen is ubiquitous today. People input sensitive information into their mobile devices including bank card number, security code, and digit PIN, etc., using touchscreens. However, we observed that people’s different interaction patterns with touchscreens generate unique electromagnetic leakage signals from the touchscreen circuits that would allow malicious parties to eavesdrop on the sensitive inputs and, pose serious security and privacy problems. To characterize the limits of information that may be leaked to malicious eavesdroppers, I collected time domain waveforms corresponding to different touch positions on the phone and analyzed their differences. I found out that we could infer the touch position with a horizontal resolution of 4 mm on the screen. My future step is to investigate a model that can precisely indicate the touch position, and the possible defenses against this security vulnerability, for example, by designing cost-effective electromagnetic shielding into the touchscreens. My works have already generated a first-authored poster submission to the 24th International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (HotMobile’23). I’m also working with a PhD student of Prof. Kevin Fu on a conference submission to the 30th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM CCS’23).
